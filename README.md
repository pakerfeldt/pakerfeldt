### Hallå där, I'm Patrik Åkerfeldt 👋

🔭 I spend my days designing software, managing teams, and crafting tech strategy at a small Swedish company that develops an esports-first streaming platform, where I serve as the CTO.

📚 Currently, I'm delving into scalable systems, global distribution, productizing tech platforms, and building high-performing, thriving teams. My passion for software remains steadfast as I also explore machine learning with PyTorch and scikit-learn. I'm focused on leveraging ML models and packaging them into internal services, continually expanding my knowledge and skills.

🌱 My journey with technology began in the 80s, when my father brought home our first PC, an IBM running on Intel's 8088 microprocessor. It was a magical moment ✨. A few years later, the Internet arrived, accompanied by the unforgettable sound of a 9.6k baud modem. I was fortunate to have a dedicated phone line early on, which allowed me to spend countless hours exploring the online world without disrupting our household landline. I'm deeply grateful to my parents for embracing this new technology early on; without their support, my passion for computers and programming might never have flourished. 🙏

⚡ Fun fact: I love brewing 🍺 and tinkering with home automation, as showcased in some of my GitHub repositories.
